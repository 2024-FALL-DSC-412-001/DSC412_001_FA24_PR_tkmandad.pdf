Title: Markowitz model with large simulation and sensitivity analysis

Summary: The primary aim of this project is to apply Markowitz model to establish
minimum variance portfolio and most efficient portfolio. While having to use a large
number of assets in the portfolio with unique combinations of those assets, it is also
crucial to optimize the efficiency in obtaining the unique weights, return, and variance
for all the portfolios that are intended to use. Lastly, relevant sensitivity will be carried
out to assess the risk

1. Data Collection
Gather historical price data for a large number of assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, ETFs).Consider using Yahoo Finance.
2. Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, adjust for stock splits, and normalize returns.
3. Return and Covariance Calculation
Calculate expected returns and the covariance matrix for the asset universe.
4. Optimization Algorithm Implementation
Implement an optimization algorithm (e.g., nonlinear programming) to determine optimal asset weights for the minimum variance and efficient portfolios. Maximizing return, minimizing variance
5. Sensitivity Analysis
Conduct sensitivity analyses by varying input parameters (e.g., expected returns, risk aversion) and observing changes in portfolio weights and risk metrics.
