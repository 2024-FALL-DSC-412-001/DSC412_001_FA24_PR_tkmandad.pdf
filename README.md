# Markowitz Model with Large Simulation and Sensitivity Analysis

## Proposal

### Problem Statement
Efficient portfolio allocation is a critical challenge in modern finance. Investors aim to maximize returns while minimizing risk, yet achieving this balance becomes increasingly complex with large asset pools. The Markowitz model provides a foundational approach to portfolio optimization, but scaling this model for large asset universes and conducting meaningful sensitivity analyses present significant computational and analytical hurdles.

### Proposed Solution
The project will implement the Markowitz model to determine the minimum variance portfolio and the most efficient portfolio for a large asset pool. This involves simulating unique combinations of asset weights, returns, and variances. To enhance efficiency, the solution will incorporate optimization algorithms such as nonlinear programming. Sensitivity analyses will evaluate the modelâ€™s robustness by varying parameters like expected returns and risk aversion.

### Potential Stakeholders
- Financial analysts and portfolio managers seeking to optimize investment strategies.
- Retail investors interested in understanding risk-return trade-offs.
- Academic researchers exploring portfolio optimization methodologies.
- Financial technology firms developing portfolio management tools.

### Potential Obstacles
- **Data Availability**: Accessing high-quality, comprehensive historical asset price data.
- **Computational Complexity**: Scaling optimization algorithms for large datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Managing missing values and ensuring data consistency.
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Ensuring that sensitivity analyses are both meaningful and interpretable.

### Novelty
This project combines the Markowitz model with large-scale simulation and advanced sensitivity analysis, focusing on practical challenges such as computational efficiency and model robustness. By optimizing the handling of large asset pools and conducting in-depth parameter studies, the project contributes to enhancing the real-world applicability of portfolio optimization techniques.

## Plan

### Data Acquisition

- **Format**: Data will be obtained in CSV or similar formats for ease of processing.
- **Access Permissions**: Ensure data is publicly available or acquire necessary permissions for use.

### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values through interpolation or removal.
- Adjust for stock splits and dividends.
- Normalize returns to ensure comparability.

### Data Organization
- Organize data into a structured format with columns for asset names, dates, prices, and returns.
- Store preprocessed data in a cloud-based repository or database for public accessibility.

### Data Analysis
- **Initial Calculations**: Compute expected returns and covariance matrices for the selected asset universe.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Analyze distributions of returns and correlations among assets.

### Model Selection
- **Type**: Implement the Markowitz model using nonlinear programming techniques for portfolio optimization.
- **Tools**: Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and CVXPY will be utilized for implementation.

### Accuracy Metrics
